## 🚀 What to Show Judges

### 1. **Live Deployment** (30 seconds)
Visit: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe8C3672A7348Fe8fF81814C42f1bf411D69C39b1

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Real contract deployed on public testnet
- ✅ 5 price oracles registered and active
- ✅ Multi-oracle fault tolerance working
- ✅ All transactions publicly verifiable

---

### 2. **Core Innovation** (1 minute)

#### Problem
Traditional DEXs suffer from:
- MEV attacks (front-running, sandwich attacks)
- Single oracle manipulation
- Unfair price execution

#### Solution
```
Multi-Oracle + Batch Settlement + Dynamic Weights = Fair Trading
```

**Unique Features:**
1. **5 Oracle Consensus** - No single point of failure
2. **Dynamic Weights (1-1000)** - Oracles rewarded/penalized for accuracy
3. **Dual Penalty System** - Mathematical scoring (Delta_1 + Delta_2)
4. **Dispute Mechanism** - 33% threshold protects users
5. **4-Phase Lifecycle** - Continuous operation (85 blocks)

---

### 3. **Live Testing** (2 minutes)

Run these commands to demonstrate functionality:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Verify deployment
yarn hardhat run scripts/verify-oracles.ts --network sepolia
```
**Shows:** All 5 oracles active with weights and addresses

```bash
# Terminal 2: Run comprehensive tests
yarn hardhat run scripts/testnet-demo.ts --network sepolia
```
**Shows:** 
- Oracle status with live prices
- Current batch phase (OPEN/ACCUMULATING/DISPUTING/SETTLING)
- User balances
- Protocol configuration

```bash
# Terminal 3: Unit tests
yarn test
```
**Shows:** 3/3 tests passing with gas reports

---

### 4. **Gas Optimization** (1 minute)

**Before:** Bubble sort for price observations
- O(n²) with many writes
- ~182k gas per settlement

**After:** Insertion sort optimization
- O(n²) but 50% fewer writes
- ~180k gas per settlement
- **Savings: ~2-3k gas (1.5-2% reduction)**

**Why Insertion Sort?**
- Optimal for small arrays (3-10 elements)
- Fewer writes than bubble sort
- Better cache locality

### 5. **Architecture Diagram** (30 seconds)

Show the 4-phase lifecycle:

```
OPEN (12 blocks) → ACCUMULATING (48 blocks) → DISPUTING (15 blocks) → SETTLING (10 blocks)
     ↑                                                                           ↓
     └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         Total: 85 blocks (~4.25 minutes)
```

Each phase has specific purpose - fully automated continuous operation.
